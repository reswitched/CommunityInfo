Welcome to ReSwitched, where we believe in your habilities.

Our goal is to hack the console to allow homebrew software. We **do not**, in any form, support piracy; our hacks allow for running and developing homebrew software applications and will not enable you to circumvent protections to permit piracy or the playing of illegitately-obtained software.
